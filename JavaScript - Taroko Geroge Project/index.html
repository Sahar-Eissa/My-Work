<div>#Connecting the World or #Controlling it?</div>
<div>Inventing the internet was for the goal of connecting the world together, however; the internet itself is a military project and its place is in the CIA. This new medium with various software applications worth investigating as it changes the society after it. Through McLuhanâ€™s view of the medium that is not neutral and it can be the message because it changes the society. We can understand the role of Twitter and other social media software in shaping a new society. A society with  magical technological tools that empowers people with new way in communication. For instance, Twitter helps to connect one to many in a rapid way and organize large masses in the Arab spring through #hashtags (Tufekci 2017). The interface of Twitter is for millions their window to the world (Manovich, 2013), however; it controls what to see through this window. These interfaces are becoming less transparent and less visible to the audience like Black boxes. This manipulates the audience through the affordances these interfaces offer or the hardware they function on it (Emerson 2014) or by treating the user as a consumer by collecting big data or by controlling the content users expose to by deletion. The more transparent these interfaces are, the more controlling they become.
The problem is capsulated in the question whether the user acknowledges the hidden power structures that control these interfaces and how can the user be innovative in using these tools to push back?
